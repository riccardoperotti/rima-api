# rima-api
API version of the rima app

Getting started on this API for a (much needed) decent rhyming dictionary in Spanish.

I got started with the consumer part of the app, which simply displays rhymes for a specific word as long as we have already analized it and stored it in our database. The analyzing part will come later, when we have finally settled on a final architecture for this.

A lot of TODOs:
* Reading config
* Creating a dependencies object to be passed to controllers
* Add Throttling
* Add Instrumentation
* Strict / exact mode where rhymes are matched syllable by syllable instead of by sound.
